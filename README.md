This repository contains the experimental code for the paper:

**Title**: Hybrid Feature-Based Machine Learning Models for Natural Product-Protein Interactions: A Large-Scale Comparison

## Overview

This project implements and compares various machine learning models for predicting interactions between natural products (NPs) and proteins using hybrid feature-based approaches.

**Note**: The code will be refactored in subsequent versions to improve modularity and readability. Additional comments and documentation will be added to enhance understanding.
